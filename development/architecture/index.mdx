# Entirius Architecture

This section contains documentation of the Entirius system architecture, including Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and general design principles.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Architecture Decision Records document key architectural decisions made in the Entirius project. They provide context, rationale, and consequences for important technical choices.

For detailed information about ADRs, including templates and processes, see the [ADR section](/development/architecture/adr).

## Architectural Principles

### General principles
- **Modularity** - system consists of independent modules
- **Scalability** - architecture supports load growth
- **Maintainability** - code is easy to maintain and develop
- **Security First** - security is a priority

### Architectural patterns
- **Modular Monolith** - single deployable unit with well-defined internal modules
- **Event-Driven** - asynchronous communication through events
- **API** -
