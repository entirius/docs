# Entirius Architecture

This section contains documentation of the Entirius system architecture, including Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and general design principles.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

ADRs are documents describing key architectural decisions made in the project. Each ADR contains:

- **Context** - situation requiring a decision
- **Considered options** - alternative solutions
- **Decision** - chosen solution with rationale
- **Consequences** - effects of the decision made

### How to create ADRs

1. Copy the [ADR template](./adr-template)
2. Assign the next number (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
3. Fill in all sections
4. Conduct team review
5. Update status to "Accepted"

### ADR List

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| [Template](./adr-template) | ADR Template | - | - |

*List will be updated as new ADRs are added*

## Architectural Principles

### General principles
- **Modularity** - system consists of independent modules
- **Scalability** - architecture supports load growth
- **Maintainability** - code is easy to maintain and develop
- **Security First** - security is a priority

### Architectural patterns
- **Microservices** - decomposition into small, independent services
- **API-First** - all components communicate through APIs
- **Event-Driven** - asynchronous communication through events
- **CQRS** - separation of read and write operations
