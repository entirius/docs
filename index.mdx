## What's Actually Broken

We've spent over a decade building e-commerce solutions. Here's what nobody talks about: **the tech stack you choose isn't the game-changer you think it is**. Talented teams ship amazing results with "legacy" platforms. Meanwhile, cutting-edge tech fails daily because of poor implementation.

The real bottleneck? Running successful **e-commerce platform** requires mastery of SEO, paid ads, fulfillment, API connections, frontend development, copywriting, social strategies, dynamic pricing, and mobile-first design. Universities don't prepare people for this. Connecting these pieces overwhelms both business owners and engineers.

And here's the kicker - e-commerce keeps expanding while the pool of people who truly understand it stays tiny.

## How We Fix This

We've packaged our experience into **ecommerce AI agents** that live inside your **ecommerce platform**. **You don't need to become an expert at everything - you get instant access to expertise for anything through our AIgents.**

Even better news? The whole thing is **open source**.

Got stuck? **Hit us up when you need help, particularly for enterprise scaling or high-availability deployments**.

## Under the Hood

![System Architecture](/images/entirius-base-big-picture.drawio.svg)

Getting started is straightforward - you need one app from each of our three core categories, plus at least one AI assistant. Think of it like assembling a minimal viable setup: perhaps a product information manager, a simple storefront, and a content system to tie them together.

From there, the modules scale with your ambitions. Launch a basic catalog today, evolve into a full marketplace tomorrow. Build native apps when you're ready. Connect smart devices when it makes sense. The architecture grows as you do.

## What This Means

You have the wheel, platform is the ship and ecommerce AI agents are your whole crew.
