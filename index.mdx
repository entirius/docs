## The Problem We're Solving

After 10+ years in e-commerce, we've seen a pattern: **technology choice matters way less than people think**. Great teams can make "outdated" platforms work brilliantly, while poor execution kills even the best tech stacks.

The real challenge? E-commerce demands expertise across SEO, SEM, logistics, integrations, web dev, content, social media, pricing, mobile optimization, and more. Schools don't teach this, and connecting all these dots is hard for both business people and developers.

Meanwhile, e-commerce grows faster than the number of people who actually know how to manage and code it properly.

## Our Solution

We build and maintain AI agents containing our decade of e-commerce knowledge. **Instead of needing to be an expert in everything, you get an expert for everything inside the platform in form of AIgents.**

What's even better? It's fully open source. Of course, you can reach out if you have problems, especially with scaling or HA production hosting.

## Architecture

**ENTIRIUS PLATFORM** consists of at least one app of each of 3 types and at least 1 AIgent. The simplest implementation is a PIM with a one-page website and CMS for that PIM.

**All ENTIRIUS MODULES** can be organized into many business models - from the simplest one-page product catalog to interactive stores, mobile apps, or your-fridge-selling-you-yogurt apps.

## Bottom Line

You pick the direction. The platform handles the execution. Everyone stays in their lane and does what they do best.
